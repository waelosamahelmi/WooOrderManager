### Steps:
1. **Create GitHub repository** for your project
2. **Push your code** to GitHub
3. **APK builds automatically** on every push
4. **Download APK** from Actions tab

### To use:
```powershell
# Initialize git and push to GitHub
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Add Android support"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/wooordermanager.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Result:
- ✅ Free automated builds
- ✅ APK downloads from GitHub
- ✅ No setup required

## 🌐 Option 2: Gitpod (One-Click Setup)

### Steps:
1. **Push to GitHub** (if not already)
2. **Open in Gitpod**: `https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/yourusername/wooordermanager`
3. **Wait for setup** (automatic)
4. **Run build command**

### To build APK in Gitpod:
```bash
npm run build && npx cap sync android && cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug
```

### Result:
- ✅ Full VS Code in browser
- ✅ 50 hours free per month
- ✅ Pre-configured Android SDK

3. **Run the script**: `./cloud-build.sh`
